    "Greek mathematicians such as Pythagoras had believed that all numbers could be shown to be fractions, believing that the number line was made up entirely of fractions, because for any two fractions we can always find another fraction in between them. Because this process has no end there are infinitely many such points. \n",
    "Hippasus [4][The Maths Book: Big Ideas Simply explained](published by Dorling Kindersley Limited), a Greek scholar is believed to have first identified irrational numbers in the 5th century BCE as he worked on geometrical problems. He applied Pythagoras's theorem which states that the square of the hypothenuse in a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, to a right-angled triangle with both shorter sides equal to one. Hippasus realised that the length of the hypothesus of such as triangle was equal to the square root of two but that the square root of two could not be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers, as a fraction. There is no rational number which can be multiplied by itself to give precisely two which means that the square root of two an irrational number. The number two is termed non-square or square free. The numbers 3, 5 and 7 and many others are also non-square with irrational square roots. Numbers such as 4, 9 and 16 are square numbers and do have square roots that are also whole numbers and therefore rational.\n",

    "In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting and ordering. Some definitions begin the natural numbers at 0 corresponding to non-negative integers 0,1,2,3... collectively denoted by $\\mathbb{N_0}$  while others start with 1, corresponding to the positive integers 1,2,3,... collectively denoted by $\\mathbb{N_1}$. The natural numbers are the basis from which other number sets are built by extension. Natural numbers are often known as the counting numbers (excluding negative integers and zero) and are discrete numbers in contrast to measuring numbers or real numbers where the values are continuous and represent a distance along a line. Real numbers can be represented as an inifinite decimal expansion.\n",

    "####  Binary representation of integers and floats and what this means for the square root of two.\n",
    "In terms of computing, computer programs are made up of binary strings of 1's and 0's which can be converted into integers. Every computer program can be converted into one of the counting numbers from the set of $\\mathbb{N}$ . According to Turing, all computer programs are countable which means they can be put into one-to-one correspondance with the natural numbers but Turing also realised that not all numbers can be calculated or computed.[Lectures notes by Ian Mc Loughlin]. The set of $\\mathbb{N}$ Natural numbers are an infinite set but it is the smallest infinite set there is and is known as countable infinite. The set of measuring numbers are all the numbers on the number line that are used for quantifying and measuring things and there is an infinite amount of such numbers between any two discrete points on the number line.\n",

    "A rational number can be expressed as the ratio of 2 whole numbers. It can be stored as an array of two numbers. (A number is rational only if it's decimal expansion becomes periodic).\n",
    "Real numbers such as $\\sqrt{2}$ have an infinite number of places after the decimal point. Computers cannot really store such real numbers as there is only a finite number of bits available to store the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers are stored on a computer with a finite number of digits so there is a finite limit on how many decimal places they can actually store. Floating point numbers are actually stored using integers in two parts, for the whole number part before the decimal point (the characteristics) and the part of the whole after the decimal point (the mantissa). \n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of two is an irrational number and therefore cannot be expressed in the ratio of two numbers in their most simplified form with the resulting implications being that the square root of two can never be stored in a computer. Instead an approximation of its value can be stored (in the same way an approximation for the irrational number $pi$ is stored). Irrational numbers are often stored as procedures which are used to calculate but not store the number.\n",

    "Newtons Method which is also known as the Newton–Raphson method, can be used to get an estimate of the square root of a number.  It is a root-finding algorithm which produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. [Newton's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) is one of many methods of computing square roots and is outlined in detail in the Wikipedia article. It outlines how the problem of finding the square root of a number $a$ can be rephrased as finding the zero of $f(x)=x2−a$ where $f$ is a single-variable function defined for a real variable $x$, with an initial guess of $x_0$ for a root of $f$. The derivative of the function $f'(x)=2x$. Rearranging the formula yields the Babylonian method of finding square roots :\n",

This is combined with the problems outlined earlier of computing and storing real numbers on a computer.\n",

It notes that we need to be concerned with the time and computational resources required in addition to the accuracy of the result."

    "Here is an extract from the article in question on the [Chi-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test) on Wikipedia from which the above table is taken. \n",
    "\n",
    ">A chi-squared test, also written as $\\chi^2$ test, is a statistical hypothesis test that is valid to perform when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis, specifically Pearson's chi-squared test and variants thereof. Pearson's chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table.\n",
    "In the standard applications of this test, the observations are classified into mutually exclusive classes. If the null hypothesis that there are no differences between the classes in the population is true, the test statistic computed from the observations follows a $\\chi^2$ frequency distribution. The purpose of the test is to evaluate how likely the observed frequencies would be assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "Test statistics that follow a $\\chi^2$ distribution occur when the observations are independent and normally distributed, which assumptions are often justified under the central limit theorem. There are also $\\chi^2$ tests for testing the null hypothesis of independence of a pair of random variables based on observations of the pairs.\n",
    "Chi-squared tests often refers to tests for which the distribution of the test statistic approaches the $\\chi^2$ distribution asymptotically, meaning that the sampling distribution (if the null hypothesis is true) of the test statistic approximates a chi-squared distribution more and more closely as sample sizes increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example chi-squared test for categorical data (extract from same Wikipedia article as above)\n",
    ">Suppose there is a city of 1,000,000 residents with four neighborhoods: A, B, C, and D. A random sample of 650 residents of the city is taken and their occupation is recorded as \"white collar\", \"blue collar\", or \"no collar\". The null hypothesis is that each person's neighborhood of residence is independent of the person's occupational classification. The data are tabulated as:\n",
    "Let us take the sample living in neighborhood A, 150, to estimate what proportion of the whole 1,000,000 live in neighborhood A. Similarly we take $\\frac{349}{650}$ to estimate what proportion of the 1,000,000 are white-collar workers. By the assumption of independence under the hypothesis we should \"expect\" the number of white-collar workers in neighborhood A to be:\n",
    "$$150 x \\frac{349}{650}\\approx80.54$$\n",
    "Then in that \"cell\" of the table, we have $\\frac{(observed-expected)^2}{expected}$ = $\\frac{(90-80.54)^2}{80.54}\\approx1.11$.\n",
    "The sum of these quantities over all of the cells is the test statistic; in this case, $\\approx24.6$. Under the null hypothesis, this sum has approximately a chi-squared distribution whose number of degrees of freedom are $\\text{number of rows}-1)({\\text{number of columns}}-1)=(3-1)(4-1)=6$\n",
    "If the test statistic is improbably large according to that chi-squared distribution, then one rejects the null hypothesis of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A related issue is a test of homogeneity. Suppose that instead of giving every resident of each of the four neighborhoods an equal chance of inclusion in the sample, we decide in advance how many residents of each neighborhood to include. Then each resident has the same chance of being chosen as do all residents of the same neighborhood, but residents of different neighborhoods would have different probabilities of being chosen if the four sample sizes are not proportional to the populations of the four neighborhoods. In such a case, we would be testing \"homogeneity\" rather than \"independence\". The question is whether the proportions of blue-collar, white-collar, and no-collar workers in the four neighborhoods are the same. However, the test is done in the same way."

    "    2. Ordinal where there is a clear ordering of the variables such as education levels (primary, secondary, tertiary)\n",
    "Categorical data is often referred to as count data because the number of observations belonging to a particular category are counted.\n",
