Every computer program can be converted into one of the counting numbers from the set of $\\mathbb{N}$ .

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "(It demonstrates how the fraction 1/3 can be approximated as a base 10 fraction as  0.3 or 0.33 or 0.333. No matter how many 3's you use the result will never actually be $\\frac[1}{3}$ but it will be increasingly a better approximation of $\\frac[1}{3}$)\n",

    "We don't notice that this is not the true value and only an approximation because of the way values are displayed. Python (and other languages) only prints *a decimal approximation to the to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine* \n",

    "- Python displays a rounded value instead of all the digits as in most situations this is enough.\n",
    "- The important point is that even though what we see printed (0.01) looks like the exact value of $\\frac{1}{10}$, the actual value that is stored is the nearest representable binary fraction.\n",

    "- The tutorial here also illustrates how there are many different decimal numbers which actually share the same nearest approximate binary fraction.

These decimal values all have the same approximation.\n",

    "- String formatting can be used to produce a limited number of significant digits.\n",

    "\n",
    ">*The square roots of the perfect squares (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16) are integers. In all other cases, the square roots of positive integers are irrational numbers, and hence have non-repeating decimals in their decimal representations.* [2]  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root>\n",

    "Getting the square root of numbers that are not perfect squares is not as straightforward.\n",

So if you are looking at the square root of 5 you would consider the square root of 4 (which is 2) and 9 (which is 3). Therefore the square root of 5 must lie between 2 and 3. Similarly for the square root of 10, look at the square root of the perfect square 9 (which is 3) and 16 (which is 4). So the square root of 10 must lie between 3 and 4.\n",
