    "A positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative which are opposite each other but when talking of the square root of a positive integer it is usually just the positive square root that is meant.\n",
    "The square root of a positive integer is the product of the roots of its prime factors, because the square root of a product is the product of the square roots of the factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The square roots of perfect squares such as 1, 4, 9 and 16 are integers. In all other cases, the square roots of positive integers are irrational numbers, and therefore have non-repeating digits in any standard positional notation system.\n",

    "An irrational number is one which cannot be expressed as a ratio of two numbers, i.e. a fraction.\n",
    "Any number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, a decimal that either ends or repeats in a recurring manner or a percentage is said to be a rational number. All whole numbers are rational as they can be represented as fractions divided by 1. \n",

    "Greek mathematicians such as Pythagoras had believed that all numbers could be shown to be fractions, believing that the number line was made up entirely of fractions, because for any two fractions we can always find another fraction in between them. Because this process has no end there are infinitely many such points. \n",
    "Hippasus [4][The Maths Book: Big Ideas Simply explained](published by Dorling Kindersley Limited), a Greek scholar is believed to have first identified irrational numbers in the 5th century BCE as he worked on geometrical problems. He applied Pythagoras's theorem which states that the square of the hypothenuse in a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, to a right-angled triangle with both shorter sides equal to one. Hippasus realised that the length of the hypothesus of such as triangle was equal to the square root of two but that the square root of two could not be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers, as a fraction. There is no rational number which can be multiplied by itself to give precisely two which means that the square root of two an irrational number. The number two is termed non-square or square free. The numbers 3, 5 and 7 and many others are also non-square with irrational square roots. Numbers such as 4, 9 and 16 are square numbers and do have square roots that are also whole numbers and therefore rational.\n",

    "A real number gives a positive result when squared. The square root of two gives a positive result when squared of 2. An irrational number has an inifinite number of decimals with no recurring pattern. This is the case for the square root of two.  The square root of 2 truncuated to 50 decimal places is 1.41421356237309504880168872420969807856967187537694\n",

    "In mathematics, the natural numbers are those used for counting and ordering. Some definitions begin the natural numbers at 0 corresponding to non-negative integers 0,1,2,3... collectively denoted by $\\mathbb{N_0}$  while others start with 1, corresponding to the positive integers 1,2,3,... collectively denoted by $\\mathbb{N_1}$. The natural numbers are the basis from which other number sets are built by extension. Natural numbers are often known as the counting numbers (excluding negative integers and zero) and are discrete numbers in contrast to measuring numbers or real numbers where the values are continuous and represent a distance along a line. Real numbers can be represented as an inifinite decimal expansion.\n",

    "####  Binary representation of integers and floats.\n",
    "In terms of computing, computer programs are made up of binary strings of 1's and 0's. Binary strings can be converted into integers. Every computer program can be converted into one of the counting numbers from the set of $\\mathbb{N}$ . According to Turing, all computer programs are countable which means they can be put into one-to-one correspondance with the natural numbers but Turing also realised that not all numbers can be calculated or computed.[Lectures notes by Ian Mc Loughlin]. The set of $\\mathbb{N}$ Natural numbers are an infinite set but it is the smallest infinite set there is and is known as countable infinite. The set of measuring numbers are all the numbers on the number line that are used for quantifying and measuring things and there is an infinite amount of such numbers between any two discrete points on the number line.\n",

    "A rational number can be expressed as the ratio of 2 whole numbers. It can be stored as an array of two numbers. (A number is rational only if it's decimal expansion becomes periodic).\n",
    "Real numbers such as $\\sqrt{2}$ have an infinite number of places after the decimal point. Computers cannot really store such real numbers as there is only a finite number of bits available to store the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers are stored on a computer with a finite number of digits so there is a finite limit on how many decimal places they can actually store. Floating point numbers are actually stored using integers in two parts, for the whole number part before the decimal point (the characteristics) and the part of the whole after the decimal point (the mantissa). \n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of two is an irrational number and therefore cannot be expressed in the ratio of two numbers in their most simplified form. Therefore the implications of this for computing is that the square root of two can never be stored.\n",
    "An approximation of its value can be stored though in the same way for the irrational number $pi$. Irrational numbers are often stored as procedures which are used to calculate but not store the number.\n",
