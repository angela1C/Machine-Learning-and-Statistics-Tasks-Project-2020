    "Floating point numbers are stored with a finite number of digits so there is a finite limit on how many decimal places they can actually store. \n",
    "- Real numbers such as $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\pi$ have an infinite number of places after the decimal point. Computers cannot really store such real numbers as there is only a finite number of bits available to store the number.\n",
    "- Floating point numbers are actually stored using integers in two parts, for the whole number part before the decimal point and the part of the whole after the decimal point. (Think it might be called the characteristics for the whole number and the mantissa for the part after the decimal point).\n",

    "- The set of $\\mathbb{N}$ Natural numbers are an infinite set but it is the smallest infinite set there is and is known as countable infinite.

Every computer program can be converted into one of the counting numbers from the set of $\\mathbb{N}$ . According to Turing, all computer programs are countable which means they can be put into one-to-one correspondance with the natural numbers but Turing also realised that not all numbers can be calculated or computed.\n",

    "This section here is based on the tutorial in the python docs at chapter 15.\n",
    "[Chapter 5 of the Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) looks at the issues and limitations associated with floating point arithmetic. It illustrates how the decimal fraction 0.125 and the binary fraction 0.001 have identical values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions\n",
    "- The decimal fraction 0.125 has value $\\frac{1}{10}$ + $\\frac{2}{100}$ + $\\frac{5}{1000}$\n",
    "- The binary fraction 0.001 has value $\\frac{0}{2}$ + $\\frac{0}{4}$ + $\\frac{1}{8}$\n",
    "The only real difference here is that the decimal fraction 0.125 is written in base 10 fractional notation while the binary fraction 0.001 above is written in base 2 notation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Unfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. A consequence is that, in general, the decimal floating-point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "(It demonstrates how the fraction 1/3 can be approximated as a base 10 fraction as  0.3 or 0.33 or 0.333. No matter how many 3's you use the result will never actually be $\\frac[1}{3}$ but it will be increasingly a better approximation of $\\frac[1}{3}$)\n",

    "On most machines today floats are approximated using a binary fraction. \n",
    "- The numerator uses the first 53 bits starting with the most significant bit\n",
    "- The denominator as a power of 2\n",
    "The binary fraction for the decimal 0.1 is `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55` which is close to the true value of 1/10 but is not exactly equal to the true value of 0.1.\n",
    "We don't notice that this is not the true value and only an approximation because of the way values are displayed. Python (and other languages) only prints *a decimal approximation to the to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine* \n",
    "\n",
    "- The true decimal value of the binary approximation stored for 0.1 is actually `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625`. It is printed as 0.1 though.\n",
    "- Python displays a rounded value instead of all the digits as in most situations this is enough.\n",
    "- The important point is that even though what we see printed (0.01) looks like the exact value of $\\frac{1}{10}$, the actual value that is stored is the nearest representable binary fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tutorial here also illustrates how there are many different decimal numbers which actually share the same nearest approximate binary fraction. The numbers `0.1`  and `0.10000000000000001` and `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625` are all approximated by `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55` . These decimal values all have the same approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- String formatting can be used to produce a limited number of significant digits.\n",
    "For example `format(math.pi, '.12g')` gives 12 significant digits while `format(math.pi, '.2f')` gives 2  digits after the point.\n",

That’s more than adequate for most tasks, but you do need to keep in mind that it’s not decimal arithmetic and that every float operation can suffer a new rounding error.\n",

    "- Python also has a [float.as_integer_ratio()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#float.as_integer_ratio) method which expresses the value of a float as a fraction. This can help when you want to know the exact value as a float. As the ratio is exact, it can be used to losslessly recreate the original value.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Representation error** refers to the fact that most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary (base 2) fractions in Python and other languages and therefore won’t display the exact decimal number you expect.\n",

    "- Almost all platforms map Python floats to IEEE-754 “double precision”.\n",
    "- 754 doubles contain 53 bits of precision. \n",

    ">*The square roots of the perfect squares (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16) are integers. In all other cases, the square roots of positive integers are irrational numbers, and hence have non-repeating decimals in their decimal representations.* [2]  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root>\n",

    "\n",
    "Getting the square root of numbers that are not perfect squares is not as straightforward.\n",
    "You have to look at the square roots of perfect squares that are close to your number in question. So if you are looking at the square root of 5 you would consider the square root of 4 (which is 2) and 9 (which is 3). Therefore the square root of 5 must lie between 2 and 3. Similarly for the square root of 10, look at the square root of the perfect square 9 (which is 3) and 16 (which is 4). So the square root of 10 must lie between 3 and 4.\n",
