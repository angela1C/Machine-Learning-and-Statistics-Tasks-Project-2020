    "[Chapter 5 of the Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) looks at the issues and limitations associated with floating point arithmetic. It illustrates how the decimal fraction 0.125 and the binary fraction 0.001 have identical values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Floating-point numbers are represented in computer hardware as base 2 (binary) fractions\n",
    "- The decimal fraction 0.125 has value $\\frac{1}{10}$ + $\\frac{2}{100}$ + $\\frac{5}{1000}$\n",
    "- The binary fraction 0.001 has value $\\frac{0}{2}$ + $\\frac{0}{4}$ + $\\frac{1}{8}$\n",
    "The only real difference here is that the decimal fraction 0.125 is written in base 10 fractional notation while the binary fraction 0.001 above is written in base 2 notation.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Unfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. A consequence is that, in general, the decimal floating-point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary floating-point numbers actually stored in the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "(It demonstrates how the fraction 1/3 can be approximated as a base 10 fraction as  0.3 or 0.33 or 0.333. No matter how many 3's you use the result will never actually be $\\frac[1}{3}$ but it will be increasingly a better approximation of $\\frac[1}{3}$)\n",

    "On most machines today floats are approximated using a binary fraction. \n",
    "- The numerator uses the first 53 bits starting with the most significant bit\n",
    "- The denominator as a power of 2\n",
    "The binary fraction for the decimal 0.1 is `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55` which is close to the true value of 1/10 but is not exactly equal to the true value of 0.1.\n",
    "We don't notice that this is not the true value and only an approximation because of the way values are displayed. Python (and other languages) only prints *a decimal approximation to the to the true decimal value of the binary approximation stored by the machine* \n",
    "\n",
    "- The true decimal value of the binary approximation stored for 0.1 is actually `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625`. It is printed as 0.1 though.\n",
    "- Python displays a rounded value instead of all the digits as in most situations this is enough.\n",
    "- The important point is that even though what we see printed (0.01) looks like the exact value of $\\frac{1}{10}$, the actual value that is stored is the nearest representable binary fraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tutorial here also illustrates how there are many different decimal numbers which actually share the same nearest approximate binary fraction. The numbers `0.1`  and `0.10000000000000001` and `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625` are all approximated by `3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55` . These decimal values all have the same approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- String formatting can be used to produce a limited number of significant digits.\n",
    "For example `format(math.pi, '.12g')` gives 12 significant digits while `format(math.pi, '.2f')` gives 2  digits after the point.\n",

    ">*The square roots of the perfect squares (e.g., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16) are integers. In all other cases, the square roots of positive integers are irrational numbers, and hence have non-repeating decimals in their decimal representations.* [2]  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root>\n",

    "Getting the square root of numbers that are not perfect squares is not as straightforward.\n",

So if you are looking at the square root of 5 you would consider the square root of 4 (which is 2) and 9 (which is 3). Therefore the square root of 5 must lie between 2 and 3. Similarly for the square root of 10, look at the square root of the perfect square 9 (which is 3) and 16 (which is 4). So the square root of 10 must lie between 3 and 4.\n",

The length of the diagonal of a perfect square is the square root of the number 2 (Pythagoras theorem). But the number two itself is not a perfect square.\n",
